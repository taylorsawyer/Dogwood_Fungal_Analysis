# Dogwood_Microbiome_Analysis

The core microbiome, defined here as the microbial taxa and their functional attributes consistently found within a specified host, can play an important role in evolution and adaptation to changing environments and stressors. This study explored the core microbiome of flowering dogwood (Cornus florida L.), an economically and ecologically important tree species found in the eastern United States. We reanalyzed data collected from a 2019 survey of the microbial communities of four different niches (roots, stem, bark, and leaves) of 20 trees found in a UT research center in Tullahoma, TN. Our core microbiome is defined as the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of fungi, bacteria, and archaea that are found across all four host niches. The taxa were identified using 16S and ITS amplicon sequences that were put through the DADA2 pipeline and subsequently analyzed in R.  The flowering dogwood microbiome consists of 7 fungal and 26 prokaryotic ASVs that are found across all four host niches. Further exploration will be required to find potential functional roles of these core microbes.
